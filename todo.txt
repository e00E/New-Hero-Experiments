General:
	Make each modifier / effect it's own modifier if possible so it is more modular.

Ooze:
	Slime trail:
		Split passive and active component so it more modular?!
		startgesture, setanimation

	Split:
	do implement clones with custom unit and not cloning a hero
	clones take xp and can lvl up
	

	Drench crashes bot games when they change back to the original team
	do try to reimplement drench with the dummy unit approach
	
	use on order event to stop drenched unit from targeting spells at their team

	Slime Trail:
	Give teleport an animation (see luaabilityexample natures prophet teleport)
	Should the Ooze disappear immedieately on teleport and reappear 1 second later?
	Should the teleport be channel or cast time (like prophet)?
	Should the teleport dodge projectiles?
	Should we remove the trail on death? This would disallow buyback into trail tp, but I like letting the slime run out normally more.
	Make a good particle.
		we can have orientation control point to show effects along a line and use that to show the direction that the ooze moved
		this way we can have a bit less particle spawns ingame
		try project on characters for cool green effect in the particle
	cane you make control point to color and to radius? YES there is Element.C_INIT_RadiusFromCPObject in initializers

	particle filters that can be projected on ground:
	filters:
		particles/
		projected
		proj
