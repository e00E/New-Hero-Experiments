Split:
the clone can sell move items :|
do implement clones with custom unit and not cloning a hero

I think drench is crashing bots
do try to reimplement drench with the dummy unit approach

Add overhead timer message for split duration.

Slime Trail:
Should the Ooze disappear immedieately on teleport and reappear 1 second later?
Should the teleport be channel or cast time (like prophet)?
Should the teleport dodge projectiles?
Should we remove the trail on death? This would disallow buyback into trail tp, but I like letting the slime run out normally more.
Make a good particle.
	we can have orientation control point to show effects along a line and use that to show the direction that the ooze moved
	this way we can have a bit less particle spawns ingame
	try project on characters for cool green effect in the particle

particle filters that can be projected on ground:
filters:
	particles/
